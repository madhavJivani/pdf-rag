OBSERVATIONS FROM TIME SERIES PLOTS\n• The series exhibits a clear upward trend, indicating\nconsistent growth in air travel over the observed period.\n• There is strong seasonality, with peaks around July–\nAugust and troughs during November–December.\n• The amplitude of fluctuations increases over time, sug-\ngesting that both trend and variability rise together.\nA.

Each year shows repeating peaks around\nmid-year (June–August), likely due to increased travel during\nsummer months. These trends make the dataset ideal for time\nseries analysis and forecasting applications.",
